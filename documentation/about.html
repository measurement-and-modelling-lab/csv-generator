<p>
  CSV-Generator is a web application for producing properly formatted correlation and hypothesis matrices for the correlation analysis programs MML-WBCORR and MML-Multicorr, both of which are linked in the header bar. 
</p>

<p>
  To create a correlation matrix, simply fill the lower triangle of the table with numbers between -1 and 1, then right click on the lower triangle (white part) to download it as a .csv file. Neither MML-WBCORR nor MML-Multicorr require the full correlation matrix, so the upper triangle is greyed out.
</p>

<p>
  To create a hypothesis matrix for MML-MULTICORR or MML-WBCORR, fill the correlation matrix with a combination of positive integers and numbers between -1 and 0.999, then right click on the hypothesis table (white part) to download it. Cells with the same positive integer are hypothesised to be equal, and cells containing a value between -1 and 0.999 are hypothesised to be equal to that value. In a single group scenario, only complete the lower triangle. In a two group scenario, use both the lower and upper triangle of the table; such that the lower triangle of the matrix is the first group, and the upper triangle is the second group. See MML-MULTICORR and MML-WBCORR tabs for more information on how to set up appropriate "Hypothesis" files.
</p>

<p>
Within CSV-Generator, only two group hypotheses are fully supported, but you can create a three or more group hypothesis in the following way:

  <ol>
    <li>Create the hypothesis matrix for the first and second group and download it,</li>
    <li>Create a hypothesis matrix for the third and (if desired) fourth group and download that,</li>
    <li>Copy and paste the contents of the second file into the first file.</li>
  </ol>

  In the case of MML-Multicorr this is irrelevant, since MML-Multicorr is restricted to single group hypotheses.

<p>
  CSV-Generator can also be used to create .csv correlation matrices for some of the functions in MML-R2.
